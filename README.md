# Python Week 1

This repository features my **Week 1 Python projects** from my self-guided learning journey. It demonstrates core Python concepts, practical data handling, and my early exploration of the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

# Content
 `first_program.py`                -A simple "Hello, World!" <br>
 `datatype_missingvalues.py`       -Handling different data types and managing missing values.  <br>
 `bools_and_conditions.py`         -Boolean logic and conditional structures.  <br>
 `loops_and_lists.py`, `list.py`   -Loop control flow and list manipulation.  <br>
 `functions.py`                    -Defining and calling functions.  <br>
 `index_sel_assign.py`             -Working with indexing, selection, and assignments.  <br>
 `strings_and_dict.py`             -String processing and dictionary usage.  <br>
 `group_sort.py`                   -Grouping and sorting techniques.  <br>
 `panda.py`, `pyplot.py`, `renaming_combining.py` - Introduction to `pandas` data wrangling and basic plotting. <br>
 `spam.py`                         -A fun or unconventional scriptâ€”possible experimentation. <br>
 `summary_functions.py`            -Using summary / built-in functions to analyze data.  <br>
 `wine_reviews.csv`                -Sample dataset for hands-on data exploration.  <br>

##  Goals & Learning Outcomes

 By the end of Week 1, I achieved:
 A firm understanding of Python basics: variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.  <br>
 Practical exposure to working with lists, dictionaries, and strings. <br>
 Initial hands-on experience with libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for plotting. <br>
 Experience in reading and using a real CSV file (`wine_reviews.csv`) for data exploration.
